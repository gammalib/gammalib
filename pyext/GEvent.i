/***********************************************************************//**
 * @class GEvent
 *
 * @brief Abstract interface for the event classes.
 *
 * This class provides an abstract interface to an event. An event can be
 * either a physical event occuring in the instrument (called an event
 * atom) or a collection of events with similar properties (called an
 * event bin). While event atoms are used for unbinned analysis, event bins
 * are used for binned analysis. The methods is_atom() and is_bin() inform
 * whether an event is an atom or a bin.
 *
 * Each event has 3 attributes: energy, instrument direction and time.
 * These attributes can be accessed and changed through the energy(),
 * dir(), and time() methods.
 * 
 * The counts() and error() methods return the number of counts and the
 * error in this number for each event. For event atoms the number of
 * counts is 1 and the error is 0. The event bins, the number of counts
 * is the number of events within a bin, and error is the uncertainty in
 * this number (typically the square root of the number, yet also other
 * schemes may be implemented).
 *
 * The size() method returns the size of an event bin, which is the
 * quantity that has to be multiplied by the probability for an event to
 * occur to predict the number of events in a bin. For event atoms this
 * quantity is by definition 1. For event bins, the size is the solid
 * angle of the event bin times the energy width times the ontime interval
 * covered by the events.
 *
 * The GEvent class does not hold any data members. Data members are stored
 * in the derived classes.
