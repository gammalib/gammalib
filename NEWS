1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes module by module the most important changes
made since the last release of GammaLib.


2. Public interface modifications
---------------------------------
The following methods have been added to the public interface:
- GObservation::events() (non-const variant)
- GFilename::operator()
- GCTAResponseTable::axis(std::string)
- GCTAResponseTable::table(std::string)
- GCTAResponseTable::has_axis(std::string)
- GCTAResponseTable::has_table(std::string)

The following methods have been removed:
- GFilename::size()

The following methods have been renamed:
- GCTAResponseTable::tables(), was GCTAResponseTable::size()
- GCTAResponseTable::axis_bins(), was GCTAResponseTable::axis()
- GFilename::is_empty(), was GFilename::empty()
- GFilename::url(), was GFilename::filename()

The following classes now use GFilename for filenames arguments instead
of std::string:
- GApplicationPars
- GArf
- GCsv
- GEbounds
- GEnergies
- GEventCube, GCOMEventCube, GCTAEventCube, GLATEventCube, GMWLSpectrum
- GEventList, GCTAEventList, GLATEventList
- GEvents
- GGti
- GLog
- GModelSpatialDiffuseCube
- GModelSpatialDiffuseMap
- GModelSpectralFunc
- GModels
- GNodeArray
- GObservations
- GPha
- GRmf
- GSkyMap
- GSkyRegions
- GTestSuites
- GXml

The return value has been changed for the following methods:
- GFits::filename() returns now GFilename instead of std::string
- GCTAObservation::eventtype() returns now std::string instead of const std::string&


3. Configuration
-----------------
None


4. Application module
---------------------
None


5. Base module
--------------
None


6. FITS I/O Interface
---------------------
The GFitsTableCol::insert() method did not work corretly for an empty column
since it de-allocated memory without having necessarily memory on disk. This
was corrected by allocating now memory after inserting elements into an empty
FITS column.

GFits now uses the GFilename class to store the FITS filename (fixes #1649).


7. Linear algebra module
------------------------
None


8. Model module
---------------
None


9. Numerics module
------------------
None


10. Observation module
----------------------
A non-const GObservation::events() method has been added to allow for
the manipulation of events within an observation without the need to
create a local copy.


11. Optimization module
-----------------------
None


12. Sky module
--------------
None


13. Support module
------------------
Add GFilename::fullname() method that returns the full filename including
any FITS extension.


14. XML module
--------------
None


15. VO module
-------------
None


16. Xspec module
----------------
None


17. Test module
---------------
None


18. Multi-wavelength interface
------------------------------
None


19. Fermi-LAT interface
----------------------
None


20. CTA interface
-----------------
The response table instrument response functions now rely on the FITS table
column names to determine the information instead of hard-wired column indices
(#1656).

Event fetching and disposal has been implemented in the GCTAEventList class by
additing the fetch() and dispose() methods. Now, events are only loaded upon
request and can be dispatched after user to save memory. The event fetching and
disposal logic has been removed from GCTAObservation (#1648).

Add GCTAEventList::remove() method to remove events from an event list.

The GCTAEventList::append() method now also appends empty elements to the
additional columns so that all event list columns have finally the same length.

The GCTAEdisp2D::compute_ebounds_obs() and GCTAEdisp2::compute_ebounds_src()
methods have been corrected so that they return the energy intervals covered by
valid matrix elements. With the code before there were problems with not setting
correctly the maximum energies of the intervals (#1662).

The extension name for the GTI HDU is now determined from the data sub-space
keyword provided in the events FITS file header. This allows to have multiple
GTIs (and also event lists) in a single FITS file. We do however require that
the event and GTI extension reside in the same FITS file. The name of the GTI
extension can be recovered using the GCTAEventList::gtiname() method. This
satisfies the feature request #1598.

A second variant of a write() method has been added to GCTAEventList that allows
specifying the events and Good Time Intervals FITS extension names. The standard
write() method will call this new write() method using the events extension name
extracted from the file name and the GTI extension name set by the m_gti_extname
member. The GCTAObservation::write() method was also extended and now has two
optional arguments that allow specifying the events and Good Time Interval FITS
extension names. These are simply forwared to the new GCTAEventList::write().
The GCTAObservation::save() method has now a special logic that decodes any
optionally specified extension in the format [EVENTS;GTI] into an events and a
Good Time Intervals extension name. These changes satisfy the feature request
#1598.


21. COMPTEL interface
---------------------
None
