The return value of the following methods has been changed:
- ...


3. Configuration
-----------------
The Python unit tests now raise exceptions instead of exiting with a non-
zero return code so that the user is not thrown out of Python after calling
gammalib.test() (#1983).


4. Application module
---------------------
None


5. Base module
--------------
None


6. FITS I/O Interface
---------------------
None


7. Linear algebra module
------------------------
None


8. Model module
---------------
The GModelSpectralNodes class now throws an exception if the energy or
intensity of a node is set to a non-positive value (#990).

The GModelSpectralSmoothBrokenPlaw class that implements a smoothly broken
power law spectrum has been added (#1948).


9. Numerics module
------------------
None


10. Observation module
----------------------
A set() method has been added to GEbounds and GEnergies to allow converting
energy boundaries into an energy container and vice versa. In addition,
conversion constructors have been added (#1977).


11. Optimization module
-----------------------
None


12. Sky module
--------------
The GWcsGLS and GWcsSFL classes have been added to support the GLS and SFL
World Coordinate System projections (#1851).

The GWcs base class now also supports CD keywords instead of CDELT keywords
(#1951).


13. Support module
------------------
None


14. XML module
--------------
None


15. VO module
-------------
None


16. Xspec module
----------------
None


17. Test module
---------------
None


18. Multi-wavelength interface
------------------------------
None


19. Fermi-LAT interface
----------------------
None


20. CTA interface
-----------------
Correct the containment radius computation in GCTAPsf2D (#1876).

The GCTAResponseIrf::rspname method has been added that returns the name
of the response function (attribute m_rspname).

Do no longer interpret a CTA calibration database as a file path in the
GCTAResponseIrf::read() method (#1969).

Add GCTARoi::contains() method that checks whether an instrument direction
is contained within the region of interest.

Lazy loading of the energy dispersion in GCTAEdisp2D has been implemented by
adding a fetch() method to the class. Now the energy dispersion is only loaded
when needed, for example for function evaluation or Monte Carlo sampling (#1940).

The GCTAEdisp2D::compute_ebounds_src method now loops over the migration to
enhance the precision in the true energy boundaries that are returned by this
method. In addition, the validity range of the table is now stored in members
of the class, and a non-zero energy dispersion is only returned for valid
elements of the response table.


21. COMPTEL interface
---------------------
None
