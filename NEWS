3. Configuration
-----------------
None


4. Application module
---------------------
None 


5. Base module
--------------
None


6. FITS I/O Interface
---------------------
The GFits::set() and GFitsTable::set() methods now only deallocate the previous
content if the reference to the argument differs from the reference of the
previous content. Otherwise the method would deallocate an instance that is
owned by the client (#2340).


7. Linear algebra module
------------------------
None


8. Model module
---------------
The GModels::set() and GModelSky::spatial(), spectral() and temporal() methods
now only deallocate the previous content if the reference to the argument
differs from the reference of the previous content. Otherwise the method
would deallocate an instance that is owned by the client (#2340).


9. Numerics module
------------------
None


10. Observation module
----------------------
The GObservation::events() method now only deallocate the previous content
if the reference to the argument differs from the reference of the previous
content. Otherwise the method would deallocate an instance that is owned by
the client (#2340).


11. Optimization module
-----------------------
The GOptimizerPars::set() method now only deallocate the previous content 
if the reference to the argument differs from the reference of the previous 
content. Otherwise the method would deallocate an instance that is owned by 
the client (#2340).


12. Sky module
--------------
The GSkyMap::projection() and GSkyRegions::set() methods now only deallocate
the previous content if the reference to the argument differs from the
reference of the previous content. Otherwise the method would deallocate an
instance that is owned by the client (#2340).

The smoothing kernel covered before only two sectors, now all four sectors
are covered. The smoothing now also works correctly in case that more than
a single sky map is comprised in a GSkyMap object.


13. Support module
------------------
None


14. XML module
--------------
The GXmlNode::set() method now only deallocate the previous content if the
reference to the argument differs from the reference of the previous content. 
Otherwise the method would deallocate an instance that is owned by the client 
(#2340).


15. VO module
-------------
None


16. Xspec module
----------------
None


17. Test module
---------------
The GTestSuite::set() method now only deallocate the previous content if the
reference to the argument differs from the reference of the previous content.
Otherwise the method would deallocate an instance that is owned by the client
(#2340).


18. Multi-wavelength interface
------------------------------
None


19. Fermi-LAT interface
----------------------
None


20. CTA interface
-----------------
Add a kludge to handle the noisy energy dispersion that is shipped with the 1DC
data and that is included in the Prod3 release. Noisy pixel values are skipped
and a slight smoothing is applied in true energy to reduce the noise level
(#2342).

The GCTAObservation::response() and GCTAOnOffObservation::response() methods
now only deallocate the previous content if the reference to the argument
differs from the reference of the previous content. Otherwise the method would
deallocate an instance that is owned by the client (#2340).


21. COMPTEL interface
---------------------
None
