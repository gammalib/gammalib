3. Configuration
-----------------
Keep existing library path in installation script on Mac OS X (#2420)


4. Application module
---------------------
None


5. Base module
--------------
None


6. FITS I/O Interface
---------------------
None


7. Linear algebra module
------------------------
None


8. Model module
---------------
None


9. Numerics module
------------------
The gammalib::gauss_integral() function was added to compute the area under a
Gaussian between two boundaries (#2422).

The gammalib::atan2() function was added to compute the arc tangens of a ratio
in radians (#2308).

The gammalib::plaw_integral() function was added to compute the area under a
power law between two boundaries (#2308).


10. Observation module
----------------------
None


11. Optimization module
-----------------------
None


12. Sky module
--------------
Add GSkyDir::cos_dist() method that computes the cosine of the angular distance
between two sky directions. Using this method avoids computation of the arc
cosine (#2309).


13. Support module
------------------
None


14. XML module
--------------
None


15. VO module
-------------
None


16. Xspec module
----------------
None


17. Test module
---------------
None


18. Multi-wavelength interface
------------------------------
None


19. Fermi-LAT interface
----------------------
None


20. CTA interface
-----------------
The integration precision of the diffuse model response was increase to cope with
sky maps that have a higher spatial resolution than the size of the PSF (#2458).

A GCTAEdisp::prob_erecobin() method has been defined and implemented in the
derived energy dispersion classes that returns the probability that a photon with
a given true energy is reconstructed with a energy comprised in a given energy
interval. The method makes use of the internal structure of the response information
and avoids a numerical integration over reconstructed energy (#2422).

A GCTAInstDir::theta() and GCTAInstDir::phi() methods were added that return the
distance to the camera centre in radians and the azimuth angle, respectively (#2308).

A rate_ebin() method was added to the interface of the GCTABackground class and
implemented for the GCTABackgroundPerfTable and GCTABackground3D classes. The method
computes for a given instrument direction the background rate integrated over an
energy bin (#2308).


21. COMPTEL interface
---------------------
None
