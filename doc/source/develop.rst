=======

GammaLib is an open source projet and you are highly welcome to contribute 
to the development.
Contributions can come in any areas: writing C++ code, contributing Python 
scripts, writing documentation, testing code, etc.

The GammaLib development is managed by a development platform that is 
accessible at `<https://cta-redmine.irap.omp.eu/projects/gammalib/>`_.
Please check out the 
`Wiki <https://cta-redmine.irap.omp.eu/projects/gammalib/wiki/Contributing_to_GammaLib>`_
on that platform that contains information on how to contribute to the
GammaLib development.

You may also want to get in the GammaLib information flow by subscribing to 
the ctools@irap.omp.eu mailing list.
To subscribe simply send an e-mail to ctools-subscribe@irap.omp.eu.

We are organising regular `Coding sprints <https://cta-redmine.irap.omp.eu/projects/ctools/wiki/Coding_sprints>`_
to allow newcomers to get familiar with the code base and the coding
practices.
You are highly invited to join one of the next coding sprints.

You can also follow `@gammalib <https://twitter.com/gammalib>`_ on
twitter to get informed about new release of GammaLib.
