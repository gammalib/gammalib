Overview
========

This module contains classes and functions that are needed for numerical 
computations within GammaLib. The module provides support for differentiation
and integration of one-dimensional functions. The interface for the 
one-dimensional functions is defined by the abstract :doxy:`GFunction` base
class, integration is performed using the :doxy:`GIntegral` class, 
differentiation is done using the :doxy:`GDerivative` class. In addition,
numerical constants and function that are extensively used throughout GammaLib
are defined in the :doxy:`GMath.hpp` header file. All constants and functions
are declared in the :doxy:`gammalib` namespace.
