   *Multi-wavelength module*

The multi-wavelength module provides an interface for spectral energy 
distributions (SEDs). The SED defines the observed photon flux as function 
of energy (or frequency) from a particular source, and this information 
can be used in a fit to determine spectral source parameters.
