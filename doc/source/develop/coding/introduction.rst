Introduction
============

This document summarises the coding and design conventions that shall
be followed for the GammaLib development.

Respecting uniform and coherent coding and design conventions is crucial
for software development. They improve code readability, ease code
development and maintenance, ensure code portability, and provide
standards for the user interface.

Coding and design conventions were introduced at a very early stage of
the GammaLib project, and are followed as strictly as possible. The
choices that were made for GammaLib were inspired by a large survey of
existing C++ coding rules, combined with the experience of the leading
code developers. Obviously, there is no single best way to code in C++,
and the adopted conventions may not meet the coding usage of individual
developers. They should nevertheless be respected strictly, as the
GammaLib code base is already very large, and assuring uniformity and
coherence is a primary goal of the project.
