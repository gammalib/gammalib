Developper documentation
========================

GammaLib is an open source projet and you are highly welcome to contribute
to the development.
Contributions can come in any areas: writing C++ code, contributing Python 
scripts, writing documentation, testing code, etc.

We manage the GammaLib source code using `GitLab <https://cta-gitlab.irap.omp.eu>`_.
We also have a `Redmine <https://cta-redmine.irap.omp.eu/projects/gammalib/>`_
development platform to file issues.

You may also want to get in the GammaLib information flow by subscribing to 
the ctools@irap.omp.eu mailing list.
To subscribe simply send an e-mail to ctools-subscribe@irap.omp.eu.

We are organising regular `Coding sprints <https://cta-redmine.irap.omp.eu/projects/ctools/wiki/Coding_sprints>`_
to allow newcomers to get familiar with the code base and the coding practices.
You are highly invited to join one of the next coding sprints.

You can also follow `@gammalib <https://twitter.com/gammalib>`_ on
