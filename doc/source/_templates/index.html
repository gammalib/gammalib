<p>{%trans%} GammaLib is a versatile toolbox for the high-level analysis
of astronomical gamma-ray data. It consists of a C++ library and a
Python module that exposes the full functionality of the library
to Python. The library provides an abstract data analysis framework
that is independent of any specific gamma-ray telescope. Instrument
specific aspects, such as handling of data formats and response
functions, are implemented as isolated and well defined modules sharing
an identical abstract interface. This enables a joint multi-instrument
analysis of data, allowing for consistent broad-band spectral fitting
or imaging. So far, GammaLib supports analysis of data obtained with
COMPTEL, Fermi/LAT, and Cherenkov telescopes (CTA, H.E.S.S., MAGIC,
VERITAS). {%endtrans%}</p>

<p>{%trans%} Except for HEASARC's cfitsio library that is used to implement
the FITS interface, GammaLib does not rely on any third-party 
software. All functionalities are implemented natively. {%endtrans%}</p>

<p>{%trans%} GammaLib is developed by a team of enthousiastic gamma-ray
astronomers with support from engineers. We regularily organise
<a href=https://cta-redmine.irap.omp.eu/projects/ctools/wiki/Coding_sprints>coding sprints</a>
where key developers but also newcomers meet to discuss the developments 
and next steps, and advance with the coding of the software. {%endtrans%}</p>

<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL license version 3</a> {%endtrans%}</p>
