Miscellaneous=============Version control---------------GammaLib applies a three-number version numbering scheme::     major.minor.patchA ``major`` revision of 0 indicates that the GammaLib design is not yetfrozen. At this level, external interfaces of GammaLib may changewithout notification, and no interface control system is implemented.The ``minor`` revision tag will be incremented for each new release,signaling that new features have become available. The ``patch`` tag will beincremented after correcting bugs that were reported on releases.Once the GammaLib design is frozen, the ``major`` revision number will beincremented to 1. From this moment on, external interfaces of GammaLibwill be under configuration control. If existing external interfaceswill be modified, the ``major`` revision number will be incremented. At thesame time, the libtool version number of the GammaLib will also beincremented. The ``minor`` revision number will be incremented ifmodifications and extensions are backward compatible. As before, the``patch`` number will be incremented after correcting bugs that werereported on releases.
