.. _sec_numerics:Numerical methods-----------------Overview~~~~~~~~This module contains classes and functions that are needed for numerical computations within GammaLib. The module provides support for differentiationand integration of one-dimensional functions. The interface for the one-dimensional functions is defined by the abstract ``GFunction`` baseclass, integration is performed using the ``GIntegral`` class, differentiation is done using the ``GDerivative`` class. In addition,numerical constants and function that are extensively used throughout GammaLibare defined in the ``GMath.hpp`` header file. All constants and functionsare declared in the ``gammalib`` namespace.Constants~~~~~~~~~The following constants are available:========================== =====Constant                   Value========================== =====``gammalib::pi``           :math:`\pi```gammalib::twopi``        :math:`2\pi```gammalib::fourpi``       :math:`4\pi```gammalib::pihalf``       :math:`\pi/2```gammalib::inv_pihalf``   :math:`(\pi/2)^{-1}```gammalib::inv_sqrt4pi``  :math:`(\sqrt{4\pi})^{-1}```gammalib::pi2``          :math:`\pi^2```gammalib::deg2rad``      :math:`\pi/180` (multiplication converts degrees to radians)``gammalib::rad2deg``      :math:`180/\pi` (multiplication converts radians to degrees)``gammalib::ln2``          :math:`\log 2` (natural logarithm of 2)``gammalib::ln10``         :math:`\log 10` (natural logarithm of 10)``gammalib::inv_ln2``      :math:`(\log 2)^{-1}```gammalib::onethird``     :math:`1/3```gammalib::twothird``     :math:`2/3```gammalib::fourthird``    :math:`4/3```gammalib::sqrt_onehalf`` :math:`\sqrt{1/2}```gammalib::sqrt_pihalf``  :math:`\sqrt{\pi/2}`;``gammalib::sqrt_two``     :math:`\sqrt{2}`;========================== =====Functions~~~~~~~~~The following functions are available:===================== ===========Function              Description===================== ===========``gammalib::acos``    Arc cosine function that avoids NaN due to rounding errors``gammalib::cosd``    Cosine function for argument given in degrees``gammalib::sind``    Sine function for argument given in degrees``gammalib::tand``    Tangens function for argument given in degrees``gammalib::asind``   Arc sine function for argument given in degrees``gammalib::acosd``   Arc cosine function for argument given in degrees``gammalib::atand``   Arc tangens function for argument given in degrees``gammalib::atan2d``  Arc tangens function for argument x/y given in degrees``gammalib::sincosd`` Returns sine and cosine for argument given in degrees``gammalib::gammln``  Natural logarithm of gamma function``gammalib::modulo``  Remainder of division x/y===================== ===========Integration and derivatives~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The following code illustrates how integrations and derivatives arecomputed within GammaLib (see ``examples/numerics.cpp`` for thesource code)::    1  class function : public GFunction {    2  public:    3      function(const double& sigma) : m_a(1.0/(sigma*std::sqrt(gammalib::twopi))), m_sigma(sigma) {}    4      double eval(const double& x) { return m_a*std::exp(-0.5*x*x/(m_sigma*m_sigma)); }    5  protected:    6      double m_a;    7      double m_sigma;    8  };    9  int main(void) {   10      function fct(3.0);   11      GIntegral integral(&fct);   12      integral.eps(1.0e-8);   13      double result = integral.romb(-15.0, +15.0);   14      std::cout << "Integral:       " << result << std::endl;   15      GDerivative derivative(&fct);   16      std::cout << "Derivative(0):  " << derivative.value(0.0) << std::endl;   17  return 0;   18  }The function that should be integrated or differentiated is defined inlines 1-8 as a class that derives from the abstract ``GFunction`` baseclass. The only method that needs to be implement in the derived class,here named ``function`` is the ``eval`` method that takes a const referenceto a double precision value as argument and that returns a double precisionvalue, which is the function value evaluated at the argument. Parametersmay be passed to the function upon construction, as illustrated by the``m_a`` and ``m_sigma`` members that are initialised by the constructor.The function is allocated in line 10 with a sigma parameter of 3. Line 11the prepares for the integration by allocating an integration object. The``GIntegral`` constructor takes a reference to the function as argument.In line 12, the relative precision of the integration object is set to:math:`10^{-8}` (by default the precision is set to :math:`10^{-6}`).In line 13, the integration is done over the parameter interval:math:`[-15,15]`. As this covers basically the entire area of theGaussian function, the result will be very close to 1 (the result isprinted in line 14). Note that the Romberg method is used for integrationby invoking the ``romb`` method. This is the only method that is so faravailable in GammaLib.Differentiating a function is similar. For this purpose, a ``GDerivative``object is created in line 15 with takes a reference to the function asargument. Using the ``value`` method, the derivative is computed in line16 for a function argument of 0. As the Gaussian has a maximum there, theresult will be 0.
