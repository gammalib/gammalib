# This script tests the accuracy of the HealPix flux computation. It sets
# a single pixel of the HealPix map, projects the HealPix map into a CAR
# map to compute the flux in the pixel in an indpendent way, and compare
# this flux estimates to that one derived from the flux() method.
#
# Note that this test relies on the correctness of the CAR flux()
# computation.
